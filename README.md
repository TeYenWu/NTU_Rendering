##Course Introduction
Introduction

Photorealistic rendering, synthesizing realistic images which are indistinguishable from real photographs, has long been a holy grail for computer graphics. Although global shading models, such as ray tracing, have been developed for quite a while, animation industry basically still used local shading models. However, owe to recent developments of ray tracing, many animation studios started to re-architect their own renderers using ray tracing. Such renderers have been used for the production of many animations and effects films, such as "Monsters University" and "The Hobbit". This course will cover the fundamentals of the ray tracing algorithm behind these renderers based on PBRT.
